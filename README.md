## Web Scraping
These examples show various ways to scrape a web page for information. One is done with a simple API call, one uses BeautifulSoup to scrap the DOM, and one uses Regular Expressions to scrape a .PHP file.

### weather.py 
Example of scraping plain html using BeautifulSoup

Returns the extended weather report for the selected location

(with optional lat and long args, otherwise defaults to Las Vegas)



#### hockey.py 
Example of scraping using an undocumented API. I found the api by inspecting the page using Dev Tools, and then used the address to make my request.


Returns the current scores for all NHL hockey games


#### gen_county.py
Example of scraping a .PHP file using Regular Expressions.


Returns active events from the Genessee County 911 Page



## Codewars
Some of the more interesting challenges I have done on Codewars.Com

#### finding_appointment.py 
Given a list of schedules and a duration, find the earliest time a meeting could be scheduled.  

#### product_of consecutive_fib_numbers.py 
Determine if a number is the product of two Fibonacci numbers.

#### enough_is_enough.py 
Given a list (lst) and a number (N), create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering.
